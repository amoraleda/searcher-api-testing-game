# Find the bug of the Searcher Endpoint

The following endpoint allows searching car models in a database. Each invocation of this endpoint triggers a single query to the database, and the executed query varies based on the parameters passed.
Car Model Search Endpoint


## Your Mission
You will have to conduct professional testing of this endpoint using automated testing methods. While it is not anticipated that you will discover a bug in the current service version, please report any bugs you may find. You can also assume that the database will not be altered during the duration of the challenge, in other words, the same query will return the same results every time.
However, be aware that upcoming changes after some days will introduce a bug in the query process. We will keep posted about the timelines.
Your mission is to automatically detect this bug and promptly raise an alarm, preferably before anyone else!

Following your successful detection, you will show your strategy and particularly the code of the test suite you used.

It is sought that the test suites owning the following attributes:
- Clarity and Comprehensibility: Tests should be easy to understand, facilitating clear comprehension.
- Conciseness:Test suites should be compact, with a size proportionate to the scope of the endpoint under examination.
- Modularity:The tests should be modular, ensuring ease of adaptation in case the endpoint undergoes changes to support additional fields.

Let's embark on this challenge together to discover new testing techniques, methods, and approaches, ultimately fostering mutual learning and collaboration. Happy testing!
